classicAspCasSaml is an unofficial CAS client to enable CAS authentication for classic ASP (VBScript) applications that require attribute release. Attribute release is made possible by posting a SAML document (over SOAP over HTTP) to CAS's samlValidate for ticket validation.

classicAspCasSaml was developed by Keene State College.
